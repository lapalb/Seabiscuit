<h1>
Completed projects</h1>
Project ACE
We have set up a Biomass Briquetting plant in Aurangabad to support the thriving industry in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper, food and textile sectors. The initial production capacity of this plant is 250 MT per month. The captive area around our plant is rich in black soil and supports cultivation of crops like cotton, soya, maize, and lentils like Tur and Urad. The plant is surrounded by closely knit network of small rivulets that support the farms in this area. The material handling processes right from raw material collection, sizing, transportation and storage are automated to a large extent to control the product quality and to eliminate errors due to human judgment. Qualified staff is deployed to operate the press shop, quality, maintenance, finance and administration. We have commenced operations in September 2013.><br>
<h1>
Upcoming projects</h1>
Project DUO
As we settle into Project ACE, we intend to double the capacity of the production line and increase the storage capacity by a factor of 7.

This project shall be accomplished by April 2015 with installation of high capacity briquetting machine and increasing the current raw material storage capacity from 100 tons to 850 tons and finished goods storage from 50 tons to 250 tons.
We are investing in building these capabilities to cater to customers well during the year, especially during the monsoons.
